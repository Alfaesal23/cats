<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>

<p>This guide is for people who would like to be involved in building Cats.</p>

<p>This guide assumes that you have some experience doing Scala
development. If you get stuck on any of these steps, please feel free
to <a href="#getting-in-touch">ask for help</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h2>

<p>Cats follows a standard
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">fork and pull</a>
model for contributions via GitHub pull requests.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the steps that might be involved in an ideal
contribution. If you don’t have the time to go through every step,
contribute what you can, and someone else will probably be happy to
follow up with any polishing that may need to be done.</p>

<p>If you want to touch up some documentation or fix typos, feel free to
skip these steps and jump straight to submitting a pull request.</p>

<h3 id="find-something-that-belongs-in-cats">Find something that belongs in cats</h3>

<p>Looking for a way that you can help out? Check out our <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues">open issues</a> and look for ones tagged as <em><strong>help wanted</strong></em> or <em><strong>low-hanging fruit</strong></em>. These issues are the easiest way to start contributing, but if you find other items that catch your eye, you’re most than welcome to tackle them!</p>

<p>Make sure that it’s not already assigned to someone and that nobody has left a comment saying that they are working on it!</p>

<p>(Of course, you can also comment on an issue someone is already
working on and offer to collaborate.)</p>

<p>Have an idea for something new? That’s great! We recommend that you
make sure it belongs in cats before you put effort into creating a
pull request. The preferred ways to do that are to either:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/new">create a GitHub issue</a>
describing your idea.</li>
  <li>get feedback in the <a href="https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats">cats Gitter room</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that belong in cats generally have the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Their behavior is governed by well-defined <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html#laws">laws</a>.</li>
  <li>They provide general abstractions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Laws help keep types consistent, and remove ambiguity or sensitivity
about how particular instances can behave. We’ve found that types with
laws are often more useful than <em>lawless</em> types</p>

<p>(In some cases, <em>lawless</em> type classes and instances are useful. We
intend to support some of these in a future module.)</p>

<p>By staying general, Cats’ abstractions are widely-applicable, and not
tied to particular libraries or strategies. Rather than being a
library to work with databases, HTTP requests, etc, Cats provides
abstractions used to build those libraries.</p>

<p>Cats (and especially <code class="highlighter-rouge">cats-core</code>) is intended to be lean and modular.
Some great ideas are not a great fit, either due to their size or
their complexity. In these cases, creating your own library that
depends on Cats is probably the best plan.</p>

<h4 id="cats-subprojects">Cats subprojects</h4>

<p>Cats has other <em>companion</em> projects, described next:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect">cats-effect</a>: a project aimed to provide a standard IO type for the Cats ecosystem, as well as a set of typeclasses (and associated laws) which characterize general effect types.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats-mtl">cats-mtl</a>: provides transformer typeclasses for cats’ Monads, Applicatives and Functors.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/typelevel/mouse">mouse</a>: a small companion to the Cats functional programming library for Scala. It includes convenience extension methods for Scala standard library classes, including some found in scalaz that are not in Cats.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="let-us-know-you-are-working-on-it">Let us know you are working on it</h3>

<p>If there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on,
leave a comment to let people know that you are working on it. If
there isn’t already an issue and it is a non-trivial task, it’s a good
idea to create one (and note that you’re working on it). This prevents
contributors from duplicating effort.</p>

<h3 id="build-the-project">Build the project</h3>

<p>First you’ll need to checkout a local copy of the code base:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone git@github.com:typelevel/cats.git
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To build Cats you should have
<a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Setup.html">sbt</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>
 installed. If you’d like, you can use the <a href="#nix-cats-development-environment">Nix Cats development environment</a>.</p>

<p>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt</code>, and then use any of the following commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">compile</code>: compile the code</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">console</code>: launch a REPL</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">test</code>: run the tests</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">unidoc</code>: generate the documentation</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">scalastyle</code>: run the style-checker on the code</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">validate</code>: run tests, style-checker, and doc generation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="scala-and-scalajs">Scala and Scala.js</h4>

<p>Cats cross-compiles to both JVM and JavaScript runtimes. If you are not used to
working with cross-compiling builds, the first things that you will notice is that
builds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Will take longer: To build JVM only, just use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">catsJVM</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">catsJS</code>
for JS only. And if you want the default project to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">catsJVM</code>, just copy the
file <code class="highlighter-rouge">scripts/sbtrc-JVM</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sbtrc</code> in the root directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May run out of memory: We suggest you use
<a href="https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras">Paul Philips’s sbt script</a> that will use the settings from Cats.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="editor-setup-tips">Editor Setup Tips</h3>

<p><strong>IntelliJ</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be warned, IntelliJ is currently not 100% accurate at reporting compilation errors, there <em>will</em> be cases that it reports errors incorrectly. If you simply don’t want to see the errors, a quick an easy work around is to disable <em>Type-Aware Highlighting</em> by clicking the <code class="highlighter-rouge">[T]</code> icon in the bottom toolbar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is an open <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/2152">issue</a> with the IntelliJ scala plugin, which prevents it from configuring similacrum correctly when importing the cats project. The work around for this issue is to set <code class="highlighter-rouge">val CompileTime = Provided</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.sbt</code>. Note: Be careful not to commit this change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IntelliJ does have <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2015/07/31/inline-refactoring-for-type-aliases-and-kind-projector-support/">support</a> for kind-projector. However, it is not always seamless. If you are unable to get IntelliJ to recognise the special symbols that kind-project provides, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">?</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Lambda[X =&gt; G[F[A]]]</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">λ[X =&gt; G[F[A]]]</code> try upgrading to the early access preview (EAP) version of the scala plugin. This can be done under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Settings &gt; Languages &amp; Frameworks &gt; Scala &gt; Updates</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="write-code">Write code</h3>

<p><a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/guidelines.html">See guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3 id="attributions">Attributions</h3>

<p>If your contribution has been derived from or inspired by other work, please
state this in its ScalaDoc comment and provide proper attribution. When
possible, include the original authors’ names and a link to the original work.</p>

<h3 id="write-tests">Write tests</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tests for cats-core go into the tests module, under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cats.tests</code> package.</li>
  <li>Tests for additional modules, such as ‘jvm’, go into the tests directory within that module.</li>
  <li>Cats tests should extend <code class="highlighter-rouge">CatsSuite</code>.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">CatsSuite</code> integrates <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a>
with <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/discipline">Discipline</a> for law checking, and imports all syntax and standard instances for convenience.</li>
  <li>The first parameter to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">checkAll</code> method provided by
 <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/discipline">Discipline</a>, is the name of the test and will be output to the
 console as part of the test execution. By convention:</li>
  <li>When checking laws, this parameter generally takes a form that describes the data type being tested.
 For example the name <em>“Validated[String, Int]”</em> might be used when testing a type class instance
 that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validated</code> data type supports.</li>
  <li>An exception to this is serializability tests, where the type class name is also included in the name.
 For example, in the case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validated</code>, the serializability test would take the form,
 <em>“Applicative[Validated[String, Int]”</em>, to indicate that this test is verifying that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Applicative</code>
 type class instance for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Validated</code> data type is serializable.</li>
  <li>This convention helps to ensure clear and easy to understand output, with minimal duplication in the output.</li>
  <li>It is also a goal that, for every combination of data type and supported type class instance:</li>
  <li>Appropriate law checks for that combination are included to ensure that the instance meets the laws for that type class.</li>
  <li>A serializability test for that combination is also included, such that we know that frameworks which
 rely heavily on serialization, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Spark</code>, will have strong compatibility with <code class="highlighter-rouge">cats</code>.</li>
  <li>Note that custom serialization tests are not required for instances of type classes which come from
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">algebra</code>, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Monoid</code>, because the <code class="highlighter-rouge">algebra</code> laws include a test for serialization.</li>
  <li>For testing your laws, it is advised to check <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/lawtesting.html">this guide</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="binary-compatibility">Binary compatibility</h3>

<p>It is important to verify that the feature you are implementing is compatible with Scala 2.11.x and Scala 2.12.x (Scala &lt;2.10.x is not supported). When you submit a PR, Travis makes this check, but it is time-expensive, so you can assure this step beforehand by issuing the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">++2.11.12</code>, which sets the cats’ Scala version to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2.11.12</code> and then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">mimaReportBinaryIssues</code>.</p>

<p>A summary of these steps is as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sbt
&gt; ++2.11.12
&gt; mimaReportBinaryIssues
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This procedure will report if there are any binary compatibility issues that should be fixed.</p>

<p>As a side note, the latter command uses <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/migration-manager">sbt-mima</a> (shorthand for “Migration Manager”) plugin and you can find more information about it <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/migration-manager/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contributing-documentation">Contributing documentation</h2>

<h3 id="source-for-the-documentation">source for the documentation</h3>
<p>The documentation for this website is stored alongside the source, in the <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats/tree/master/docs">docs subproject</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The source for the tut compiled pages is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docs/src/main/tut</code></li>
  <li>The menu structure for these pages is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docs/src/main/resources/microsite/data/menu.yml</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="generating-the-site">Generating the Site</h3>

<p>run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt docs/makeMicrosite</code></p>

<h3 id="previewing-the-site">Previewing the site</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install jekyll locally. Depending on your platform, you might do this with:</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">yum install jekyll</code></p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get install ruby-full; gem install jekyll</code></p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install jekyll</code></p>

    <p>Or just dropping into a <code class="highlighter-rouge">nix-shell</code> if you are using the <a href="#nix-cats-development-environment">Nix Cats development environment</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a shell, navigate to the generated site directory in <code class="highlighter-rouge">docs/target/site</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start jekyll with <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to http://localhost:4000/cats/ in your browser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make changes to your site, and run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt docs/makeMicrosite</code> to regenerate the site. The changes should be reflected as soon as you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">makeMicrosite</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="compiler-verified-documentation">Compiler verified documentation</h3>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/tpolecat/tut">tut</a> to compile source code
which appears in the documentation, this ensures us that our examples
should always compile, and our documentation has a better chance of
staying up-to-date.</p>

<h3 id="write-examples">Write examples</h3>

<p>One of the best ways to provide examples is doctest, here is <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/Functor.scala#L19-L33">an example</a>. Doctest is a <a href="https://github.com/tkawachi/sbt-doctest">sbt plugin</a> which generates tests based on the syntax mentioned above and runs when sbt’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">test</code> task is invoked. You can find more information in the plugin documentation.</p>

<h3 id="submit-a-pull-request">Submit a pull request</h3>

<p>Before you open a pull request, you should make sure that <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt
validate</code> runs successfully. Travis will run this as well, but it may
save you some time to be alerted to style problems earlier.</p>

<p>If your pull request addresses an existing issue, please tag that
issue number in the body of your pull request or commit message. For
example, if your pull request addresses issue number 52, please
include “fixes #52”.</p>

<p>If you make changes after you have opened your pull request, please
add them as separate commits and avoid squashing or
rebasing. Squashing and rebasing can lead to a tidier git history, but
they can also be a hassle if somebody else has done work based on your
branch.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-do">How did we do?</h2>

<p>Getting involved in an open source project can be tough. As a
newcomer, you may not be familiar with coding style conventions,
project layout, release cycles, etc. This document seeks to demystify
the contribution process for the cats project.</p>

<p>It may take a while to familiarize yourself with this document, but if
we are doing our job right, you shouldn’t have to spend months poring
over the project source code or lurking the
<a href="https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats">Gitter room</a> before you feel comfortable
contributing. In fact, if you encounter any confusion or frustration
during the contribution process, please create a GitHub issue and
we’ll do our best to improve the process.</p>

<h2 id="getting-in-touch">Getting in touch</h2>

<p>Discussion around Cats is currently happening in the
<a href="https://gitter.im/typelevel/cats">Gitter channel</a> as well as on Github
issue and PR pages. You can get an overview of who is working on what
via <a href="https://waffle.io/typelevel/cats">Waffle.io</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to open an issue if you notice a bug, have an idea for a
feature, or have a question about the code. Pull requests are also
gladly accepted.</p>

<p>People are expected to follow the
<a href="http://typelevel.org/conduct.html">Typelevel Code of Conduct</a> when
discussing Cats on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other
venues.</p>

<p>We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If
you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or
that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and
contact one of the <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats#maintainers">project maintainers</a>
in private. We hope to avoid letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings
escalate into larger problems.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, please contact one of <a href="https://github.com/typelevel/cats#maintainers">us</a>
immediately so that we can support you.</p>

<h2 id="nix-cats-development-environment">Nix Cats Development Environment</h2>

<p>Since Cats development can include the Scala runtime, the Scala.js runtime, the Cats website, and more; a number of dependencies (SBT, Node.js, Jekyll, etc) can be needed to work on Cats. Managing these dependencies globally can be a hassle and can lead to version conflicts. To make this easier to manage in an isolated development environment, Cats provides a <code class="highlighter-rouge">shell.nix</code> for anyone using the <a href="https://nixos.org/nix/">Nix package manager</a>.</p>

<p>To use the Nix-based Cats development environment:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://nixos.org/nix/download.html">Install</a> the Nix package manager.</li>
  <li>At the root level of the Cats repository, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">nix-shell --pure</code>. This will drop you into a minimal bash shell that has just the required dependencies on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code>. Note that the first time that you run this it will take some extra time to download the necessary dependencies into your local Nix store.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sbt</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code>, etc as required from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nix-shell</code>.</li>
  <li>When you are finished you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> the <code class="highlighter-rouge">nix-shell</code>.</li>
</ol>
